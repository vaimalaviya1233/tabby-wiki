It's been a while..

But alas.

Welcome back.

# Everything new in Tabby 3.0

Quick note: you can always access this page from Tabby's Settings Page

## Advanced search

**Indexed search -** Tabby will search in wikis now. And articles. It's like Full-Text search but only `article` tags, `section` tags and stuff like that are considered.

**Plus.. Regex support!**  `re:/abc/is`

Ah, and the search box won't be cleared when you close Tabby. Handy!

## Multiselect

At last,

- `Cmd/Ctrl` to select tabs
- `Shift` to range select
- `Cmd/Ctrl+<clicking on a window>` to select all (visible) tabs within a window
- `A` to select all
- `I` to invert the selection

And since we're on the topic of shortcuts,

- `Shift+S` brings you to the current tab

## (っ◔◡◔)っ Theming

Dark and classic themes, and custom themes!

**Help wanted:** Right now there's only 2 themes available, if you make one feel free to pop in and make a PR!

### Save-for-later saves compression
### Save-for-later syncing works with Multi-account containers
### Window name prefacing - The name you give a window shows up on the window

## Finally...

- Performance improvements

Since I can't get to every edge case myself, bug reports really help! (Especially since this one is a full rewrite)

Thanks :D
